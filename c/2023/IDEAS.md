day 1:
day 2:
day 3:
day 4: union find breadth first??
day 5: union find and path compression? or maybe not? tree branching? negative ranges?
ford-fulkerson: max flow

=> apply mapping on ranges and not every singles number inside the range.... (mix of range set union/intersection/etc.)

day 6: binary search, int overflow 101
day 7:
day 8:
day 9: sum of x in xs == 0 is NOT x == 0 for all x in xs...
day 10: ray casting with edge case handling, winding number algorith, pnpoly didn't work?
day 11: breadth first search overkill because we are in a grid
day 12: bf + dynamic programming
day 13: hamming distance
day 14: cycle detection, floyd warshall / brent but needs a graph?
day 15: rip bufread
day 16: loop instead of rec? count while going to gain iterations
day 17: path finding, A*, dijktstra with priority queue (heap queue), table based dynamic programming, etc. + bucket queue?
day 18: shoelace formula + pick's theorem, also applies to day 10
day 19: negative ranges, overflows...
