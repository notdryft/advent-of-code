day 1:
day 2:
day 3:
day 4: union find breadth first??
day 5: union find and path compression? or maybe not? tree branching? negative ranges?
ford-fulkerson: max flow

https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/18b9ohu/2023_day_5_animated_part_2_example/

=> apply mapping on ranges and not every singles number inside the range.... (mix of range set union/intersection/etc.)
=> also: https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/aoc/blob/2023/day5.js

day 6: binary search, int overflow 101
day 7:
day 8:
day 9: quadratic sum, x in xs == 0 is NOT x == 0 for all x in xs...
day 10: ray casting with edge case handling, winding number algorith, pnpoly didn't work?
day 11: breadth first search overkill because we are in a grid
day 12: bf + dynamic programming
day 13: hamming distance
day 14: cycle detection, floyd warshall / brent but needs a graph?
day 15: rip bufread
day 16: loop instead of rec? count while going to gain iterations
day 17: path finding, A*, dijktstra with priority queue (heap queue), table based dynamic programming, etc. + bucket queue?
day 18: shoelace formula + pick's theorem, also applies to day 10
day 19: negative ranges, overflows...
day 20: BFS, cycle detection? buggy array_push which breaks strings? struct ordering with dyn arrays? random result??
day 21: BFS, euclidian remainder, newton interpolating polynomial, possible to just count without modifying grid?
day 22: dominator (control-flow graph)?
day 23: longest path is np hard, DFS, BF and throw DP into the mix?, no alloc > *
day 24: line-line intersection, SMT solvers (Z3), lup decomposition? gaussian elimination, chinese remainder, BF
